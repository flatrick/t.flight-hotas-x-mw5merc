# Configuration file for a Thrustmaster T.Flight HOTAS X in Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries

The game Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries doesn't correctly identify the device **Thrustmaster T.Flight HOTAS X** properly,
and the in-game settings for HOTAS/joysticks is slightly lacking.

Instead you're asked to [follow a PDF-instruction on how to configure your own mapping](https://static.mw5mercs.com/docs/MW5HotasRemappingDocumentation.pdf), 
but most of us don't want to redo this anytime we switch PCs and so I decided to store such a configuration for the HOTAS I own.

I found one pre-made by a user on reddit, but my specific settings may come to change over time, which is why I created this repo to keep track of the latest version.

The file needs to be stored in the folder `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MW5Mercs\Saved\SavedHOTAS\` with the filename `HOTASMappings.Remap`

As always, save the original file in case you want to use the original file created by the game (in my case, the game threw out a config for THRUSTMASTER TWCS Throttle + THRUSTMASTER T.16000M Joystick).
